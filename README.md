Intergalactic Translator

This is a chrome extension that allows you to video chat with others from around the world and communicate in their native language. Simply choose the language you speak, and put in the name of the person you would like to contact. IGT will translate what you say in real-time so each user will hear the other in their native tongue.

This project was developed at AngelHack Austin May 2015
